🕵️‍♂️ Stealth Indeed Job Scraper
This project is a stealth-mode web scraper designed to extract job listings from Indeed without triggering anti-bot mechanisms. It mimics human behavior using randomized mouse movements, scrolling, user agents, and stealth browser configurations — all while using your local Chrome profile instead of incognito.

Simulates human-like behavior (scrolling, delays, random mouse movements)

Automatically manages ChromeDriver via webdriver_manager

Extracts detailed job info (title, company, location, description)

Saves scraped data to a CSV file (single_job_data.csv)

Targeted for Indeed Pakistan but can be easily modified for other locations
